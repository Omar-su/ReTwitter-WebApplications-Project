<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<h2 id="overview"> OverView</h2>
The goal of this project is to create a clone of twitter for the DAT076 / DIT127 Web applications course at chalmers. The web application will allow users to interact with each others posts by either liking or replying. 

The app will also offer users a feed of news that will show news a day before the call. 

The backend or server side of the application is located in the server/src/ directory. Here you can find directories for the services, the model, the routers and the database. There are also end-to-end tests in the start.test.ts file in server/src/ as well as some unit tests in the test files located in server/src/service/.

The frontend is located in client_mockup/client/src with the components being located in client_mockup/client/src/components.

The project report is located at the root directory of this repository and is named "Project Report - ReTwitter. Group 3"

The group of students working on the project: 

Omar Suliman : @omar-su <br>

Newscatcher API is a powerful news data extraction and aggregation service that empowers developers to access news articles from thousands of sources worldwide. By leveraging advanced algorithms and natural language processing techniques, Newscatcher API efficiently identifies and collects articles on a wide range of topics, from business and technology to sports and entertainment.

Incorporating this API into our project has a specific goal: to provide users with engaging and thought-provoking news topics to discuss and explore. We understand that news can evoke strong emotions, ranging from controversy and complexity to sadness and tragedy. In today's tech-savvy world, we believe that writing and discussing news online is the most effective way to express these emotions and facilitate meaningful discussions. We are confident that integrating Newscatcher API into our app will help us achieve this goal and enhance the user experience.
